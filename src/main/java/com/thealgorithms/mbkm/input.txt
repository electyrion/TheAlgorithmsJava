There is a list of balls of different colors, 2 balls of same colors
destroy each other if they are continuous and the list shrinks:

Example 1: If balls in starting are
Red Blue Blue Red -> Blues will destroy each other so it becomes:
Red Red -> Again Reds will destroy each other
                Finally 0 balls are left

Example 2: If balls is starting are
        G Y Y G B B R
        G G R
        R
        Finally 1 Red ball remains

Problem is: Design a Solution that takes this list of ball


iter 0
stack = []
balls = G Y Y G B B R
iter 1
stack = G
balls = Y Y G B B R
iter 2
stack = G Y
balls = Y G B B R
iter 3
stack = G
balls = G B B R
iter 4
stack = []
balls = B B R
iter 5
stack = B
balls = B R
